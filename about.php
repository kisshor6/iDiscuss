        <strong>Learn What Your Customer Wants.</strong> We’re in a world where consumer data is widely available, and your hotel content marketing strategy could fall flat unless you’re using data to back it up. But how do you get started? 

If you’re ahead of the game and already have some blogposts or videos, check your analytics. Note what’s getting the most traction and expand upon concepts you’ve previously touched on by making them into full-length offerings that stand on their own. 

You can also look at the performance metrics on your social media channels. Find out what’s converting, and plan to create more in-depth articles or videos about those topics. It’s also useful to analyze what’s working for your competitors. 

The Google Ads Keyword Planner is another tool that will get your content in front of people who want to see it. And don’t forget that it can be as easy as simply asking your following questions! People love to be involved (more on this in point 7 below..)

        <strong>Make Your Content Interactive .</strong> Generating new business is an ongoing challenge for every resort and real estate project. When the numbers are down, it’s tempting to focus towards a new ad campaign or offering additional incentives to industry partners. 

If someone was to tell you that Content Marketing could solve your problems, you’d probably be sceptical. It sounds fluffy, and let’s face it: unless you’re an avid writer, it probably feels like a burden to sit and write thousands of words every week on top of all of the things you already do. 

In today’s world however, 84% of people want brands to entertain them, solve their problems, and give them experiences. Content marketing achieves that.  It also helps with SEO: websites with blog posts get 434% more search engine-indexed pages than those without them. 

And not only does content marketing potentially get you three times as many leads for 62% less money, but additionally, Hubspot recently found that marketing teams who prioritize content marketing are 13x more likely to achieve a strong, positive return on investment (ROI).
